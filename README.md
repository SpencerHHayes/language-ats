# Snippets

Atom gives developers the ability to enable snippets, basically coding shortcuts, into their packages. This package also supports a number of snippets. To use, first take a look at the list of Snippets over on the language-ats settings within Atom. Simply type the trigger phrase for the snippet you want to use, and either tab or hit enter and the snippet will activate.
